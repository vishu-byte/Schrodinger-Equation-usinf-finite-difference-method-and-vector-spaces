# Schrodinger-Equation-usinf-finite-difference-method-and-vector-spaces
Given SchrÃ¶dinger equation is solved using finite difference method and eigenvalue problem. Any three eigenfunctions can be plotted.

//GIVEN WAVE EQUATION IS OF THE FORM
/* 
        y''= A(r)y(r)
        y(0)=0
        y(n)=0  lim n-->inf
*/
/* We write the above equation in form:
        H|y> = E|y>         ..(Eigen Value Problem)
where,
H=T+V (Hamiltonian Operator)
Also, ket |y> is a vector of N dimensional function space(N is user input)
*/        


Steps on how to use this program:
i) Define Potential function and boundary conditions
ii)Enter N(dimension of vector space/number of points to be plotted)
iii)Enter the value of eigen value for which you want to plot eigenfunctions(ex:1,2,5)(any three)
iv)See the output result
